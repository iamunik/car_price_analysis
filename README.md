<h2 id="cleaning"><b>1. Cleaning A car price dataset</b></h2><hr>A jupyter notebook file that consists of python libraries used to clean a csv dataset "cars.data", the dataset contains several columns and empty rows that needed cleaning, dummy variables was created becuae the csv file is going to be used for some machine learning models and the notebook was created and step by step comments on each block was made so as to make the user understand what happens per block of code. <b>Name of project (car_price_cleaning.ipynb)</b>

<h2 id="engineering"><b>2. Engineering Features on a dataset</b></h2><hr>This dataset has already been cleaned in the first notebook (car_price_cleaning.ipynb), the already cleaned dataset was then imported into this notebook, feature engineering (Called data engineering by some people) was done on the dataset to pick the features that can actually be used in our model for a better accuracy. <b>Name of project (car_price_engineering.ipynb)</b>

<h2 id="model"><b>3. Model Creation and prediction on a dataset</b></h2><hr>This dataset has already been cleaned in the first notebook (car_price_cleaning.ipynb), the already cleaned and used to engineer the features in (car_price_engineering.ipynb), the already engineered features were used to train models and and make prediction, after the models have been trained they were tested and evaluated. <b>Name of project (car_price_model.ipynb)</b>
